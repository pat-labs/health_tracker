## Context

Modern lifestyles often lead to decreased physical activity and less mindful eating habits. This can result in various health issues. Many individuals are seeking convenient and effective ways to monitor their health metrics and make positive lifestyle changes. Existing solutions often lack comprehensive features, user-friendly interfaces, or seamless data integration.

## Hyothesis

By developing a comprehensive and user-friendly health tracker application, we can empower users to:

-  [] Increase awareness of their daily activity levels and dietary habits.
-  [] Identify trends and patterns in their health data.
-  [] Make informed decisions to improve their overall health and well-being.
-  [] Achieve their fitness goals more effectively.

## Goals

[] Develop a mobile application (iOS and Android) that allows users to track their:

-  [] Steps taken
-  [] Calories burned
-  [] Food intake (including nutritional information)
-  [] Sleep patterns
-  [] Water consumption
-  [] Heart rate (if integrated with wearable devices)

[]Provide clear and insightful visualizations of tracked data.
[]Offer personalized recommendations based on user data and goals.
